  * Update watch file to pick up the "weird" number we now have.

 -- Paul Gevers <elbrus@debian.org>  Sat, 03 Oct 2015 16:20:46 +0200

nedit (1:5.6~cvs20081118-9) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Markus ]
  * Patch source/preferences.c for language mode setting when a file is loaded:
    Now first use the file extension and then look in its contents. The former
    order prevented correct language detection due to ambigous recognition
    patterns.
  * Add patch "ewmh-raise" to raise a (partially) hidden nedit window when
    opening a new file from nedit-nc.
  * Add patch "move tab by drag and drop" to be able to move tabs around
  * Patch source/window.c to allow multiple tab rows
  * Add a small patch to Microline/XmL/Folder.c to make longer parts of
    filenames visible on tabs when many files are open. TODO: Still more
    characters could be shown in the bottom row.
  * Improve desktop integration (nedit.desktop)

  [ Paul Gevers ]
  * Update description so it mentions that UTF-8 files are not supported to
    prevent wrong expectations.
  * Add d/NEWS to describe how to activate the multirow tabbing and the drag
    and drop feature

nedit (1:5.6~cvs20081118-8) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jari Aalto ]
  * Removed deprecated dpatch and upgrade to packaging format "3.0 quilt"
    (Closes: #664439).
  * Standards-Version bumped to 3.9.4 (no changes needed).
  * Updated debhelper to 9 due to moving rules to dh(1) format. The dh(1)
    format makes it possible to utilize hardened build flags easily in the
    build process.
  * Added ${misc:Depends} to control files (Lintian).
  * Removed 80_Update_version_description.patch and moved version update
    to rules file. The version string cannot be set from a patch because it is
    modified during the build dynamically from the current date.
    (Closes: #694644)
  * Added 90_build_no_ask.patch to build unattended. CFLAGS
    option -DBUILD_UNTESTED_NEDIT would otherwise display
    "HIT ENTER TO CONTINUE" question.
  * Use hardened build flags; for this the sources also needed a new
    92_format_string.patch.
    http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/SecurityHardeningBuildFlags
  * Update d/copyright to the machine-readable format v1.0
  * Remove spurious whitespaces from debian files

  [ Paul Gevers ]
  * Update my e-mail address
  * Remove 70_EditVersionText.dpatch as the current version of the library
    is not known-bad
  * Add Vcs-* fields to d/control
  * Set package to Multi-arch: foreign
  * Remove build-depends on libxp-dev (Closes: #623662)
  * Build against libmotif-dev instead of lesstif2-dev now it finaly entered
    main (should get rid of quite some old bugs).
  * Create all CFLAGS in d/rules, thus 20_ChangeFlagsLinuxMakefile.patch is
    obsolete. Now build with BUILD_UNTESTED_NEDIT and HAVE__XMVERSIONSTRING, and
    without USE_DIRENT and USE_LPR_PRINT_CMD. The later means the default for
    the print command is now lp i.s.o. lpr.

    off-by-one error, potentially causing a crash (upstream bug 2858723)
  * Added 40_Pointer_to_Integer.dpatch to fix compiler warning on 64 bit
    (from upstream bug 2846694)
  * Added 80_Update_version_description.dpatch to create a version
    string reflecting the real version, i.e. a cvs checkout of 5.6.
  * Updated patches to comply with DEP3 format for patches.

nedit (5.02-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompile against lesstif 0.89 and compile with -DUSE_XMIM.
    From the Lesstif 0.88.9 Release notes:

      Fixed the problem with nedit and accelerators. nedit installs and
      removes accelerators _alot_. The mask were were using to install and
      remove event handlers did not match, therefore the handler was not
      removed, but all the data the handler used was freed. Needless to say
      strange things happened after this.

    Looks like the nedit bugs are _finally_ fixed (thanks to Bjoern Brill
    for letting me know).

     seem to have been lesstif bugs, or I already fixed them and forgot to
     close them, so this release lets me close out all the pending bugs.

nedit (5.02-1) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * Fixed minor packaging issues so lintian would shut-up.
  * This is an upstream bug-fix release.  Bug fixes include:

	 - -import did not work as advertised in 5.0.1. When used, it
	   re-set a number of preferences back to default values. Could
	   also potentially cause a crash.
	 - Macro -> Repeat crashes on some systems.
	 - Mouse state can get "stuck" on Alpha-based systems.
	 - Combination of auto-wrap, auto-indent, and unbreakable lines
	   extending the width of the window, caused nedit to unnecessarily
	   insert blank lines.
	 - Incorrect case-insensitive comparison in character sets > 128
	   bits.
	 - in by-word drag-selection (double click then drag) when begun
	   in the middle of a whitespace selection, anchor would revert
	   to original cursor position rather than maintaining the entire
	   whitespace block.
	 - Language mode names containing spaces could not be used in
	   language sensitive user-defined menu items.
	 - New windows did not always see existing learn/replay sequence,
	   recorded before the window was created.
	 - Possible crash in search_string and search_window macros, when
	   used with long search strings.
	 - Possible crash in get_selection("any") macro.
	 - Under Solaris, crashes on window opening, file dialog, and
	   language mode selection, when user-defined sub-menus were used.
	 - Filenames containing spaces could cause the .neditdb file to
	   become unreadable.
	 - Escape key could not be used to cancel file-selection dialogs
	   when the file list had keyboard focus (which it almost always does).

     lesstif, and that lesstif still has a few problems that may affect

nedit (5.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a stupid bug where I put things in /usr/bin/X11 instead of
     /usr/bin/X11R6, but debian doesn't have this symlink (just me ;-)
     This fixes bug #15135 and #15425
  * added in the proper update-alternatives stuff per the new editor policy
  * renamed "nc" to "nedit-nc" to avoid naming conflict with netcat.

nedit (5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source.  Changes include:
       - Syntax highlighting with patterns for C, C++, Java, Fortran, Pascal,
         Ada, Perl, Python, Tcl, Awk, Csh, HTML, LaTeX, VHDL, Verilog, etc.
       - Completed macro extension language (Simple C/awk-like syntax)
       - Language-sensitive preferences
       - Continuous wrap and automatic-newline wrapping modes
       - Configurable right-button pop up menu
       - Searchable on-line help
       - Programmable Smart indent.
       - Word boundary matching (<>) in regular expressions
       - Bug fixes.
  * libc6
  * Converted to use debhelper
  * Now uses lesstif (no more nedit-dmotif and nedit-smotif).  Lesstif
     now seems stable enough for Nedit to work fairly well.  The font selection
     dialog box still doesn't work, and the right-mouse-button menu seems to
     lock things up sometimes, but most everything else seems to work!
