nedit (1:5.6~cvs20081118-9) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of NEdit includes some patches to enhance tabbed editing. To
  enable drag and drop you should add the following lines to your X-resources
  file, be it ~/.Xresources, ~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xdefaults-<hostname> or any
  of the other possible locations: 
  ! Enable drag & drop with tabs
  nedit.dragDropTabs:true
  nedit.dragDropTabsAnimation:true

  You can now also enable a maximum number of tabs in one row. It you open more
  files an additional row will be added. To set this number add a line like the
  following to your X-resources:
  ! Maximum number of tabs in one row
  nedit*XmLFolder.tabsPerRow: 8

  You can activate your X-resources file by either logging out and in or by
  using the following command (for ~/.Xresources) :
  $ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
